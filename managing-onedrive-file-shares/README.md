# Managing OneDrive File Shares

When you need to share large files over email,
and the size of those files exceeds the limits set our mail server,
OneDrive provides a solution.

## üë∂ Accessing OneDrive

To access OneDrive through your web browser,
visit [office.com](https://www.office.com).

![Login with your City email address](login-email.png)

Log in using your **City email address**.

![Select work account](login-work.png)

If asked, select **Work or school account**.

![Enter your password](login-password.png)

Enter your regular **Windows login password**.

![Approve the multi-factor authentication request](login-mfa.png)

**Approve the multifactor authentication (MFA) request.**

Depending on your choice of MFA,
this may require approving with the Microsoft Authenicator app on your phone,
or entering a six-digit number displayed on a keychain device.

Depending on if you have used OneDrive before, the link may appear in a few different places.

-   Under "Home" in the left hand list of applications.
-   In the "App Launcher" menu, opened using the button in the top-left corner.
-   In the "View More Apps" menu, opened using the button in the bottom-right corner.
-   By searching for "OneDrive" in the "Search" field at the top.

## üë©‚Äçüéì Familiarize Yourself with OneDrive

![OneDrive Home](onedrive-home.png)

On the left side menu, you can select the area of OneDrive you want to access.
The most important options include:

-   **My Files**, which shows files in your personal OneDrive repository.
-   **Shared**, which shows files you are currently sharing and files shared with you by others.
-   **Recycle Bin**, which shows files you have deleted, with the option to recover them.

## üí° Set Up Your OneDrive for Sharing

Although not necessarily required, organizing your OneDrive prior to sharing
can greatly improve your sharing experience. üôÇ

**I highly recommend starting by creating folder named "Shared Files"
in the root of your OneDrive.**

> Having a folder grouping together all of your shared information
helps keep things organized when you are sharing files with multiple people.
It also helps keep you in the mindset that files saved in this folder
will likely become available to people other than just yourself.

![OneDrive Home](onedrive-newFolder.png)

To create a new folder, click the blue **New** button,
and select **Folder**.

![Create Folder](onedrive-folderName.png)

In the dialog window, enter the folder name.
Click **Create** to save it.

## üì§ Sharing Folders Using OneDrive

> ‚≠ê Although it is possible to share single files in OneDrive,
it is **not recommended**
as sharing folders is far easier to do securely.

Inside the **Shared Files** folder, create a new folder for the files
that will be shared.

> ‚≠ê When choosing a folder name for the folder you will be sharing,
be sure **not to include** any information in the name that is confidential.
The full folder path will be shared with the recipient of the shared folder.

Open that new folder.  Upload the files that need to be shared.
Files can be uploaded using the **Upload** button in the top menu,
or by dragging the file from a Windows Explorer onto the web browser.

## Important Notes

‚≠ê When sharing links, only share links generated using the **Share**
or **Copy Link** buttons in OneDrive.
**Never** copy the link from your web browser's address bar.
The web browser uses a website address that will not work for the people
you wish to share with.
